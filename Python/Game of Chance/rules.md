A user can bet on any number from 0 to 30:
- If it’s an even number, they 2x their money back.
- If it’s a multiple of 10, they get 3x their money back.
- If it’s a prime number, they get 5x their money back.
- If the number is below 5, they get a 2x bonus.

Create a program that allows the user to guess a number. A random number is generated. If the user guess is the same as the random number, then the user wins. After 10 goes, their name and score are written to a file.
